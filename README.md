# Middesk's Postman Collection

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/17049420-cd3e58c4-4e7b-4940-b0ac-61bfd9b19bbd?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D17049420-cd3e58c4-4e7b-4940-b0ac-61bfd9b19bbd%26entityType%3Dcollection)

#### Intro

The postman collection focuses on two products in the Middesk API. They focus on 
1. Businesses (https://docs.middesk.com/reference#businesses)
2. Webhooks (https://docs.middesk.com/reference#webhooks) 

The goal is to help you learn more about how to interact with business creation, management, and observing changes to the businesses youâ€™ve ordered.

#### How to use

The postman collection uses a single variable called `API_KEY` to interact with all endpoints. You will need to provide your `API_KEY` in the Postman collection. You can do this by clicking on the main folder (Businesses and Webhooks Collection), clicking on the Variables Tab, and placing your `API_KEY` under the `API_KEY` variable.
