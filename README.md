The Middesk Webhooks & Business Postman Collection

Intro

The postman collection focuses on two products in the Middesk API. They focus on 
1. Businesses (https://docs.middesk.com/reference#businesses)
2. Webhooks (https://docs.middesk.com/reference#webhooks) 

All endpoints, in both Businesses and Webhooks are covered, and the goal is to help you learn more about how to interact with business creation, management, and observing changes to the businesses you’ve ordered.

How to use

The postman collection uses a single variable called API_KEY to interact with all endpoints. You will need to provide your API_KEY in the Postman collection. You can do this by clicking on the main folder (Businesses and Webhooks Collection), clicking on the Variables Tab, and placing your API_KEY under the API_KEY variable.

You can then go to each endpoint, under the project folder, and then click “Send” to see it in action!

The goal

The postman collection only focuses on two features of the Middesk API. The hope is we can bring more endpoints and variables to provide more intractability with our API.
